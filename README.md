To check if you have `Node.js` anf `Angular` installed, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
node -v
ng v
```

If you get an answer like this, it means that `Node.js` and `Angular` are installed and you may go to the [next section](#then-install-the-booking-app).

```sh

```sh

npm install npm@latest -g
```

npm clone git@github.com:mcdieg/libheros-client.git
npm clone git@github.com:mcdieg/libheros-api.git
```

You may now access the app `http://localhost:4200/booking`
